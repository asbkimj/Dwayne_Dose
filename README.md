<h1> Dwayne the Rock Twitter Bot</h1>
<strong> Description </strong>
<p>
Dwayne the Rock Johnson, an interational hero, seems to be lacking an rock-based pun twitter account. This project attempts to rectify that. This project attempts to make a twitter bot that posts daily pictures of Dwayne the Rock Johnson with rock-related puns and quotes. 
</p>

<strong> Inspiration </strong>
<p>
As someone who does not have a twittter account, the idea for this project came from an episode of the podcast "Planet Money" in which the hosts launched a bot that trades stocks based on Trump's tweets; this was supposed to be documented on the bot's twitter page. However, since Trump hadn't tweeted about any companies since its creation the bot just tweeted bad repetitive jokes about being a bot. I found that amusing so I thought, why not make one for Dwayne the Rock Johnson? There's probably one out there already, but the world could always use one more.
